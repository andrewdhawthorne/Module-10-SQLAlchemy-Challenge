# Module-10-SQLAlchemy-Challenge
files for Data Boot Camp Module 10 SQLAlchemy Challege

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge I analyzed climate data from Hawaii to prepare for a fictional holiday. Using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib, I performed the following analysis: 

1. Plot precipitation in Honolulu over the previous twelve months from the most recent date in the dataset (August 23, 2017)

    #### The highest rainfaill (in) occured between the end of August and beginning of November 2016. 

2. Plot a histogram of the temperature obvervations over the previous twelve months of data from the most active station. 

    #### The most frequent temperatures recorded are between 75 and 80 degrees (assumed Fahrenheit)

3. Design a climate app to allow for others interested in vacationing in Hawaii to check the historical temperature and precipitation records.
